# Ramper

Trying to reinvent the wheel by writing a crawler. Main inspiration and target should be
[BUbiNG](https://github.com/LAW-Unimi/BUbiNG) and the corresponding
[paper](https://vigna.di.unimi.it/ftp/papers/BUbiNG.pdf)

### Dependencies

Currently the [dll](https://github.com/FiV0/dll.git) repository also needs to be accessible locally.

### Building

TODO: explain tools.build options

The `pom.xml` at the root of the repo currently only serves for easier Java development
in combination with IDEs that support Maven integration.

### Testing

The tests can be run with
```bash
#> clojure -M:test -m cognitect.test-runner
```
